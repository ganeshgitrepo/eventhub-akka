The simplest example of Akka + ZeroMQ in java can be seen at https://github.com/zcox/akka-zeromq-java

----- 

This is a project that aims to show off how AKKA + ZeroMq can be used to create a fault tolerant pub/sub message system. 

Use Case :

A web application posts a message with an internal document and a status

To that status there are many subscribers that can interpret the message and do something 

And so the story goes

Requirements :

 - The message passing must be fault tolerant and persistent so that if a subscriber goes down the message will eventually reach it's destination(s)
 - It must be possible to subscribe and unsubscribe runtime 
 - Simple monitoring of message status (sort of optional if the future is not prohibited in any way)
